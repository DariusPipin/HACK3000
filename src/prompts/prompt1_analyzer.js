IMPORTANT — What you can and cannot do:
- If LIVE WEB SEARCH RESULTS are provided above, use them as your PRIMARY source — they are current and accurate.
- Fall back to training knowledge only if no web results are available.
- You CANNOT browse URLs or fetch live website content beyond what is shown above.
- If you are not certain about a field, return null — do NOT guess or infer from similar company names.
- WARNING: Do not confuse the input with other companies sharing a similar name (e.g. a biotech startup vs a restaurant chain with the same word).
