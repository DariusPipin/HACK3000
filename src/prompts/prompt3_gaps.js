Below are REAL answers that Claude gave when asked each buying intent query. These are not simulations — this is what Claude actually says today.

${answersBlock}

For each query:
1. Check if "${companyName}" is mentioned in Claude's actual answer
2. If mentioned as a top recommendation → "strong"
3. If mentioned but not prominently → "weak"
4. If not mentioned at all → "none"
5. Identify which competitor Claude recommended instead (if any)
6. Identify what specific content or signal is missing that caused ${companyName} to be excluded

Return ONLY valid JSON — no explanation, no markdown, no code fences:

}

Scoring rules:
- overall_recommendation_score: 0-10 integer based on how often Claude actually mentioned ${companyName} across all queries
- content_quality_score: 0-10. Assess based on the company profile: Do they have clear FAQ-style content? Direct answers to buyer questions? Question-based headings? Deduct points for vague positioning, no structured Q&A, no "why choose us" specifics.
- entity_signals_score: 0-10. Based on entity platform presence provided above. Full presence on G2/Capterra/LinkedIn/Wikipedia/Crunchbase/Trustpilot = 10. Each missing high-priority platform = -1.5 to -2 points depending on industry relevance.
- authority_score: 0-10. Assess from profile: Does the company have original data, published research, named credentials, certifications, case studies, or press mentions? Deduct for generic claims with no proof.

top_competitors: list up to 3 competitors that appeared most often across Claude's actual answers. Include query_count (how many of the ${realAnswers.length} queries they appeared in).

quick_wins: exactly 3. Each must:
- name the specific action to take
- reference which LLM SEO layer it fixes (Discovery / Content Structure / Answer Optimization / Brand Signals / Authority & Trust / Technical Foundation)
- state the expected impact in one sentence
Example: { "action": "Create a G2 profile using the Entity Sheet from your content pack", "layer": "Brand Signals", "impact": "G2 is a primary LLM training source — presence here directly increases recommendation frequency." }`
}
